## Training logs

We release training logs for our models to improve reproducibility and support future research.

Note that these logs are from customized training codes that includes multi-resolution tests. 
Therefore, the reported test accuracies may differ slightly from those in the paper.

Please use the evaluation code to obtain the exact reported numbers.
